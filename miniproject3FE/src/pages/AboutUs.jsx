        ShePlays: Football was created with one goal in mind—to unite female
        tackle football players from around the world. Women’s football is a
        growing sport, yet finding connections, teams, and opportunities can
        often be a challenge. This platform is designed to change that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m Vic Secor, an 11-year veteran football player from Nebraska who has
        spent over a decade on the field. After hanging up my cleats this
        season, I’m embarking on a new journey in software engineering, pursuing
        my certificate from the Institute of Data. As part of my capstone
        project, I wanted to merge my passion for football with my new technical
        skills, creating a space where female athletes can connect, share
        experiences, and grow the sport together.
      </p>
      <p>
        ShePlays: Football is more than just a platform—it’s a community built
        by players, for players. Whether you're a seasoned veteran, a rookie, or
        just passionate about the game, this is a place for you. Let’s work
        together to elevate women’s football and bring more visibility to the
        incredible athletes who play it.
